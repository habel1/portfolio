### Undergraduate researcher + psychology student at Simmons University

I am currently a student at Simmons University (anticipated '26), 
where I am earning my BA in Psychology, with a double minor in Statistics and Health Humanities. 
My research interests include the clinical and personality area, specifically relating to therapy 
interventions for and risk factors of high-risk mental health disorders.

I am proficient performing data analysis with the programming language R, and have experience
with quantitative analysis techniques for psychology research, such as survival analysis
and conditional inference decision tree modelling for suicide risk. I also have experience 
using SPSS and am currently learning using Python for data analysis. A project I am currently
developing involves using big qualitative data to investigate the subjective experience of
people hospitalized in psychiatric institutions using sentiment analysis and thematic coding.
