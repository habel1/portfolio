## Zoe Habel
### Undergraduate researcher + psychology student at Simmons University

I am currently a student at Simmons University (anticipated '26), 
where I am earning my BA in Psychology, with a double minor in Statistics and Health Humanities. 
My research interests include the clinical and personality area, specifically relating to therapy 
interventions for and risk factors of high-risk mental health disorders.

I am proficient performing data analysis with the programming language R, and have experience
with quantitative analysis techniques for psychology research, such as survival analysis
and conditional inference decision tree modelling for suicide risk. I also have experience 
using SPSS and am currently learning using Python for data analysis. A project I am currently
developing involves using big qualitative data to investigate the subjective experience of
people hospitalized in psychiatric institutions using sentiment analysis and thematic coding.

### Data Visualizations in R
#### Stressors in the LGB Population

This is the first "mini project" I created for my STAT 228: Intro to Data Science course at Simmons University. 
The aim of the mini project was to practice data visualizations using ggplot with an interesting data set. 
I've included the brief intro blurb from the blog post down below.

People who identify as sexual gender minorities such as lesbian, gay, or bisexual are at unique risks for 
several health outcomes. 
In order to further explore some of the potential vulnerabilities for certain health 
outcomes, I analyzed a national cohort study of LGB people. 
The survey was given in 3 waves once a year for 3 years, so there is longitudinal data on 
participants as well.

To look at some of the unique circumstances, I decided to look at the measures 
of Everyday Discrimination, Internalized Homophobia, Psychological Distress and 
Social Wellbeing as potential contributing factors to negative health outcomes. 
I was interested in seeing if certain identities are more likely to experience 
certain healthcare outcomes. 
Additionally, I also wanted to see how well represented different groups were across 
the study as a whole and at each wave.

### Data Cleaning + Wrangling in R

#### An example using Alone survivalists

This is the second mini project I completed for STAT 228: Intro to Data Science at Simmons University. 
The aim for this project was to give a tutorial detailing the data cleaning and wrangling process with 
dplyr functions. I chose to use a data set which detailed the statistics of survivalists 
on the TV Series Alone. I've included the brief introduction from the blog post down below.

Alone is a survival show which started in the US and has now expanded to Australia. 
The premise of the show is for several survival experts to try to outlast each other in the wilderness 
with limited survival supplies and in complete isolation. See the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alone_(TV_series)) 
for further details on the series.

Statistician Daniel Oehm created 4 excellent data sets containing various statistics from the TV series. M
ore info about the data sets can be found on his [blog](https://gradientdescending.com/alone-r-package-datasets-from-the-survival-tv-series/) 
and on the [github repository](https://github.com/doehm/alone) containing the source code.
